## cognify

Cognify is an application that analyzes faces to detect a person's mood and use the results to play a perfectly tailored playlist on Spotify.

Cognify is written in C# and uses Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services "Emotion API" to detect faces and recognize emotions.

## Usage

1. To run Cognify, open `Cognify.sln` in Visual Studio. Click `Build > Build Solution`.

2. The application will ask for an API key, available for free on the [Microft Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/try/cognitive-services/?api=face-api).

3. Finally, enter the directory of a stored picture to analyze and the program will take it from there.
